# hbv7d_ui

This project relies on a jar file which can be fetched from the other repo within the orginization at https://github.com/HBV401G-Group-7D/HBV401-7D

Start by opening the other non UI REPO and going into the maven section within your IDE, then go to Lifecycle and then find the option that says "install", then run it so that the Jar file can be installed

If the MainApplication.java file does not run after that, please make sure that the dependencies within pom.xml are correct and match the jar installed by maven.

If it is incorrect you will need to change pom.xml to the right version.

Then you can run MainApplication.java and the main program will start.
